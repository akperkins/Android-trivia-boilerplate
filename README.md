###Trivia Apps

As you can probably already tell, I am pretty big geek that loves trivia about my favorite pieces of fiction. I also love building software. What happens when you combine these two hobbies? You get this FOSS repo. I hope to eventually build high quality trivia apps for every one of my favorite shows (Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad, and the Walking Dead :-) )

If you are looking to contribute, have a look at the contributing section below. However, feel free to help. No fan, regardless of the show, should have to live without a fantastic trivia app any longer! 

...unless they use the iPhone (*but really you should be using an Android anyway*) :-)

My goal is to have only the res (resource) folder differ between branches, which will equate to different application. The trivia code base should build all app-specfic objects from the data located in the res folder.

Apps out that were built from this repo:

# Spartacus Trivia App  [![Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Spartacus.Trivia)
Unfortunately, I lost the keystore for this application so it cannot be updated. :-(

# Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Trivia App  [![Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trivia.girlwithdragontattootrivia&hl=en_GB)

The keystore is lost for this one as well. :-(
