Apps out that were built from this repo:

# Spartacus Trivia App  [![Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Spartacus.Trivia)

# Game Of Thrones Trivia App  [![Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GameOfThrones.Trivia)

As you can probably already tell, I am pretty big geek that loves trivia about my favorite pieces of fiction. I also love building software. Combine these two hobbies and you get this FOSS repo. I hope to eventually build high quality trivia apps for every one of my favorite shows (Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead :-) )

Feel free to help. No fan, regardless of the show, should have to live without a fantastic trivia app any longer! Unless they use the Iphone :-)
