My Spartacus Trivia for the Android market. This is currently an application on the android market.

The version of the code on this repo is an earlier build version (and incorrectly files mixed with another android project
that I was working on at the time) than the one that is on the google play market.
Unfortunately that code is lost however I plan to restore the application and maybe port it to one of
my newer favorite shows (Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead :-) ) whenever I get the free time.
